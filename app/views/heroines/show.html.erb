<!-- right now, i just have a link to the powers_path which then gives you the ability to click on whatever power is associated with a specific heroine -->



<!-- for link of power was thinking to do  -->
<!-- link_to @heroine.power.name, power_path(@power) -->
<!--  then defined @power = Power.find(params[:id]) in my show method in the heroines_controller, but then it was picking up weird power_id that did not exist-->
